mt_iv3	I'm guessing you a broncos fan now?
mt_iv4	Wait, which valid point?
mt_iv5	I'm telling Dan you said his thigh is gross.
mt_iv6	Never made spaghetti before.
mt_iv8	It's not my fault people don't take dance seriously.
mt_iv9	I'm prettier than you.
mt_iv100	That's what I call a successful snow day.
mt_iv12	I guess patience will pay off.
mt_iv13	I like this man!
mt_iv14	But you can't call him a bust before getting drafted.
mt_iv16	Starting to compile a playlist for Saturdays show.

mt_iv43	I hope today is a good day.
mt_iv45	Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.
mt_iv47	So don't make this difficult for me baby.
mt_iv49	Could you please help spread the word!
mt_iv51	I don't think he can last the distance.
mt_iv52	If you stop acting that way, then I can.
mt_iv53	And it still hurts.
mt_iv54	I have the best coworkers ever.
mt_iv55	You've never been to a wedding?

mt_iv83	This isn't just Twitter.
mt_iv84	That guy I won't mention clearly has issues with you.
mt_iv85	I walked into work yesterday with my sunglasses on.
mt_iv86	Even his voice can't make me feel better today.
mt_iv87	I'm the only person I know that loves this song.
mt_iv88	We talked and laugh.
mt_iv89	Was it like national college mail day or something?
mt_iv90	Heard this for the first time in ages today.
mt_iv92	I get chills imagining Cruz and Rubio smiling.
mt_iv93	Try to learn something today.
mt_iv94	I got my haircut last Wednesday or Thursday.
mt_iv95	Finally someone who understands how I feel.
mt_iv96	Should I start playing it again?
mt_iv99	I just wish I could tell them.
mt_iv101	Seriously so much better off without you.
mt_iv102	It's a good and a bad thing.
mt_iv103	Maybe I was wrong.
mt_iv104	Good you are going!
mt_iv106	Just wanna be with someone's time and effort.

mt_iv133	Do not expect me to befriend you again.
mt_iv134	Scam before you get scammed.
mt_iv135	The next event will have nothing but high level quests!
mt_iv136	Sacrifices must be made for the bloodline.
mt_iv137	This has given me the fear!
mt_iv138	I'm just going with the flow of things.
mt_iv140	Does this earn us a first knockout round spot?
mt_iv143	I will never know why I care so much.
mt_iv145	Hello Gerald, it's very nice to meet you!
mt_iv147	But it happened this year!

mt_iv175	How much are you guys paying for books?
mt_iv176	I'll be in Cleveland for a week.
mt_iv178	Just finished today's Colin and Greg live.
mt_iv179	That's just false advertising if you ask me.
mt_iv180	I'll still go to my family's dinner.
mt_iv181	I hate seeing some of you disrespect countries.
mt_iv182	But hey, what's new.
mt_iv183	Is election decided already?
mt_iv185	Today has been a terrible day.
mt_iv186	People always asking if the devil fathered me.
mt_iv187	Having first period tomorrow is going to be weird.
mt_iv188	I think it's time to get a new Sriracha bottle.
mt_iv190	And it is a cowardly thing to do.
mt_iv191	This video has me so hyped for Phelps and USA!
mt_iv193	Ben is an emotional assassin.
mt_iv196	That was actually a question.
mt_iv197	I really do try to be a good friend.

mt_iv200	The best answer for this?
mt_iv201	Trumps deflection strategy is almost desperate.

mt_iv204	I'm sorry these drivers are gladiators.
mt_iv205	I was gonna ask you what their ship name was!
mt_iv206	Now, pay for your betrayal!
mt_iv207	I'm so ready to give up.
mt_iv208	I cling to the little moments.
mt_iv210	I'm on the right track.
mt_iv213	When she thinks she can leave you.
mt_iv215	Thank you for your kind list add.
mt_iv216	Best wishes with everything!
mt_iv217	Still supporting the boys through everything!
mt_iv218	Putting yourself out there.

mt_iv220	Bring back the gold girls!
mt_iv221	How your feet feel?
mt_iv222	I hate Monday's, I really do.

mt_iv237	I'm getting one for Mya now.
mt_iv239	If you move honestly.
mt_iv240	I want a Margarita.
mt_iv241	No such thing as job security.
mt_iv242	Another day of pokemon catching!
mt_iv244	I guess that's why Cruz stands for the Constitution.
mt_iv245	His stances on social issues will be mocked incessantly.
mt_iv246	Do you even know anything about rugby?
mt_iv247	I miss you so much right now, where are you?
mt_iv248	Have they sedated Donald Trump?
mt_iv249	We have that at my counter!
